# currency-by-country
Currency by Country is a 24hr Hackathon project whcih uses a currency api as well as a country info api to allow the user to search various countries through an interactive map to calculate the user's finances in a chosen country. The API was working, but due to being on a free trial, we ended the trail so we won't get charged.
